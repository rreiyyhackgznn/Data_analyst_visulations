# Data Visualization – Python Practice Repository

This repository contains my **data visualization and analysis practice projects** developed using Python.  
The main focus is on understanding datasets through visual exploration and applying different visualization techniques.

The work in this repository is learning-oriented and documents my hands-on experience with multiple data science libraries.

Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – fundamental plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn** – statistical and high-level data visualization
- **TensorFlow** – basic data handling and learning experiments
- 
 Topics Covered
Throughout this repository, I practiced:

Data Visualization
- Line plots, bar charts, histograms
- Scatter plots and basic comparisons
- Statistical visualizations using Seaborn
- Understanding data distributions and correlations

 Data Preparation
- Cleaning and preparing data before visualization
- Transforming datasets for analysis

Introductory Machine Learning Concepts
- Basic experiments using TensorFlow
- Understanding data flow and model input structures

The repository includes:
- Python scripts and notebooks focused on visualization and analysis
- Example datasets used during practice
- Visualization outputs generated as part of learning exercises

Each file represents a specific topic or visualization task.

Purpose of This Repository
- Improve my ability to analyze and visualize data
- Learn how different visualization libraries complement each other
- Gain exposure to basic machine learning workflows
- Build a learning-based portfolio for internship applications


📌 *This repository reflects my learning progress as a Computer Engineering student.*
